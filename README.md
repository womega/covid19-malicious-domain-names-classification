## Description

This repository includes the dataset feature descriptions and code used in the article above.

The repository is organized as follows:

* **benign_domains** - contains all the examples of benign domains in csv format
* **malign_domains** - contains all the examples of malign domains in csv format
* **dataset** - contains the malign and benign domains in csv format
* **dataset_description** - contains the main characteristics of the dataset
* **evaluate.py** - runs all the evaluations (online and oflline) and builds the tables/figures in the paper using the **imports_.py**, **offline_eval.py**, **online_eval.py**, **helper_functions.py** scripts.

The extracted features can be exploited by conventional machine learning algorithms or combined with other features for experiments.
